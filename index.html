            <p>First off, I hope that you enjoy my first website layout and navigation. In case you missed the few times my name has been plastered around the webpage, my name is Michael and I am a first time web development student. The course began in December of 2020 and will last 32 weeks covering a variety of subjects related to web development. I was born on the Texas coast but have spent most of my adult life traveling either for pleasure or for volunteer work. I have always been interested in computers and coding however never had an opportunity to spend proper time learning the subject. This opportunity came in the midst of COVID-19 and I have been enjoying it since the start. It is a lot to learn and comes with many frustrations but, again, fun nonetheless. </p>
            <p>I currently live in Dallas, TX and have part time jobs until I can get my career on the move with the knowledge and skills to be learned in this course. </p>
            <p>If you have any questions please feel free to contact me by LinkedIN on the left navigation link or by clicking the email button. </p>
